# Remote Desktop Services have changed (May 2025)
Lab machines are the new endpoints that will be connected when you select 'ECC Remote Lab'

Each time you reconnect to a machine you will need to login using your UNR NetID (Username) and Password in the feilds that look like the ones below.

Notes:
 - Refreshing the tab will end your session, you will have to reconnect and it will set you up with a different device
 - Only 1 remote session is allowed at a time per user
 - If a class is coming up:
   - You will be informed 15 minutes before to save work and sign out
   - A new connection to a device will not be allowed within 1 hour before class starts in a specific lab
   - Local connections are restricted to a device when a remote session is happening
