# Updating SAP 2000 24, CSiBridge 2016, and ETABS 20

UNR has an upcoming license server change for the SAP 2000 24 program. Therefore, we have to manually update the license server beforehand.

**Note: If you have SAP 2000 18 and/or ETABS 18, those applications are no longer updated by their respective companies, which means you will have to install SAP 2000 24 and ETABS 20 instead.**

If you do not have SAP 2000 24, CSiBridge 2016, and/or ETABS 20 installed, contact ehelp@engr.unr.edu to be put on an access control list.

If you are on the access control list, please visit [SAP and CSiBridge](https://www.engr.unr.edu/software/sap/) to install SAP 2000 24 and CSiBridge 2016. For ETABS 20, please visit [ETABS 20]()

**Note: You will need administrative access on your device to update the license server.**

1. Download the new INI file: <a download="LMHOST.INI" href="/guides/remote/assets/files/LMHOST.INI" title="LMHOST.INI">
LMHOST.INI </a> (Right click the blue link and click "Save link as")
2. Click Keep and Save the file as "LMHOST". The file will download usually in Downloads. You may move the file to Desktop for convenience with steps shown below.
