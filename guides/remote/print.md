## Finding the IP Address

3. Some printers will have the IP Addresses listed on the wake up screen (For example: 172.20.195.205). If this is the case for your printer, note the IP Address carefully and skip to "Using the IP Address". If your printer does not show the IP Address directly, continue on in this section.

4. All printers are capable of printing out its network configurations, which include its IP address and other network facts. 

**Make sure to have cartridge and paper to print out its network facts**

5. Navigate to network settings on the printer via pannel buttons. They are usually under "Reports", "How to Connect menu", or "Network Configuration" (usually arrows). Below shows what network settings will look like on several example printers.

2. Click "Add Printer..."
3. In the "Enter a network address or search..." bar, enter the IP Address you obtained in the previous section, including the periods. OR, if your printer shows up without having to type anything, you can just click it and select it. 
4. If everything is correct, a printer should be fixed to your printer screen and have the prompt "Ready".
5. Set the printer as a default printer by clicking the Gear Icon next to the printer and checking "Use Printer by Default"

4. Click "The printer that I want isn't listed" and click "Add a local or network printer as an administrator".
