#Updating SAP 2000

UNR has an upcoming license server change for the SAP 2000 18 program. Therefore, we have to manually update the license server beforehand.

1. Open Notepad
![Step 1](/guides/remote/images/SAP2000-1.PNG)
   
2. Type in "license-0.engr.unr.edu"
   
3. Click File in the top left of the window and save the file in somewhere reachable (Desktop/Downloads) as "LMHOST.INI"
   
4. Open folder explorer
   
5. Get to the directory: This PC > Local Disk (C:) > Program Files > Computers and Structures > SAP2000 18
   
6. Copy and paste the LMHOST.INI file from step 3 into the SAP2000 18 folder
   
7. Overwrite old LMHOST.INI file
   
8. SAP2000 18 should now be updated to the newest license server
